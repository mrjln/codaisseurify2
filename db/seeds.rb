# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:


#seed some events
artist_1 = Artist.create(
  name: string,
  biography: text,
  hometown: string,)

artist_1 = Artist.create(
  name: string,
  biography: text,
  hometown: string,)

artist_1 = Artist.create(
 name: string,
 biography: text,
 hometown: string,)

artist_1 = Artist.create(
 name: string,
 biography: text,
 hometown: string,)

#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
